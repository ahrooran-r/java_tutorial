Actor
    -> Name, Path       => can locate actor with these parameters
    -> Message          => any class that is serializable
    -> Message Queue    => When one actor tells another actor something, that is put into the actor's queue
    -> Behaviour        => Actors have code that tells them what to do when there is a message
                        => will take the message out of the queue and process it one at a time

    -> Each actor runs in its own thread
    -> Actor won't share data (each actor has its own state -> variables in actor's memory space won't be shared)
    -> Messages must be immutable (hence thread safe)
        => actor can copy the data and then change it
        => but original data cannot be changed
    -> processing of a message cannot be interrupted (hence no interrupted exception)

    -> Manager actor can hold a collection to hold results
