Merge sort
-----------

time complexity -> O(N logN)
space complexity -> Theta(N)
comparison based algorithm
not an in-place algorithm
divide and conquer algorithm
very stable
-> best choice for sorting a linked list, in this situation,
it is easy to implement a merge sort in a way that it requires only Theta(1) extra space

-> JAVA uses MergeSort for sorting reference types, such as Objects
-> and QuickSort for sorting primitive types such as int, char, long etc.

although heapsort has same time complexity, it's space complexity is Theta(1)
efficient quick sort algorithms would outperform merge sort

                    QuickSort                   MergeSort
in-place                Yes                         No <- Need additional space
stable                  No                          Yes
time-complexity     Quadratic sometimes         O(N logN)
