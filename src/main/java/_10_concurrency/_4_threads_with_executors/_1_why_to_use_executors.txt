Types of executors
-------------------------

1. SingleThreadExecutor
------------------------
-> Has a single thread so we can execute processes sequentially
-> every process is executed by a new thread

2. FixedThreadPool(n)
------------------------
-> This is how we can create thread pool with n threads
-> n is the number of cores in cpu
-> if more tasks than threads, then the tasks are stored in a LinkedBlockingQueue

3. CachedThreadPool
--------------------------
-> number of threads is not bounded
-> if all threads are busy and new task comes, then new thread is created
-> if thread is idle for >60s, then it is removed
-> used for short parallel tasks

4. ScheduledExecutor
---------------------
-> we can execute given operation at regular intervals
-> we can use it to delay a certain task
