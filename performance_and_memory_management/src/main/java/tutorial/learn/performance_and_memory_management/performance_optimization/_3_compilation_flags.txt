                            -> then the option name such as `PrintCompilation`
                            -> flags are case sensitive
                                    i.e., XX should be capital and
                                            option name should be camelCase similar to typical java naming style)

                                   col_number       meaning

                                   -> 1             # of milliseconds since VM started

                                   -> 2             order in which method or code block is compiled

                                                        not in order -> means some parts took longer to compile
                                                        could be because of
                                                            1. multi threading issues
                                                            2. code complexity
                                                            3. longer code block

                                   -> 3             n -> native method
                                                    s -> synchronized method
                                                    ! -> there is an exception handling going here
                                                    % -> code has been natively compiled, and is now running in a special part of memory called code-cache
                                                      -> i.e., method is now running in the most optimal way possible

                                   -> 4             this column has numbers 0 - 4
                                                        this column tells us what kind of compilation has taken place
                                                    0   ->  no compilation
                                                    1
                                                    2       level 1 - 4 -> increasing level of compilation
                                                    3
                                                    4   -> at this point highest level of compilation occurred

                                   -5               now we have the line of code that is actually compiled
                                                        mostly system code because we did not run this for longer times


-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+LogCompilation    -> instead of printing it to console, this command will log the result
