We can choose which compiler to be used at runtime

-client         -> select client compiler

No special flags here.
However, in some OSs, the tier 4 compilation still takes place, unfortunately.
i.e., this `-client` flag is ignored

However, this is still useful since startup time will be lower as analysis will be minimal

-server         -> select server compiler
