A function, or more generally an expression, is called REFERENTIALLY TRANSPARENT if a call can be replaced
by its value without affecting the behavior of the program. Simply spoken, given the same input the output
is always the same.

// not referentially transparent
Math.random();

// referentially transparent
Math.max(1, 2);

A function is called PURE if all expressions involved are referentially transparent.
An application composed of pure functions will most probably just work if it compiles.
